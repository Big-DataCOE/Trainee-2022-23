    <string name="content">With the idea of imparting programming
    knowledge, Mr. Sandeep Jain, an IIT Roorkee alumnus started a
    dream, GeeksforGeeks. Whether programming excites you or you feel
    stifled, wondering how to prepare for interview questions or how to
    ace data structures and algorithms, GeeksforGeeks is a one-stop solution.
    With every tick of time, we are adding arrows in our quiver. From articles
    on various computer science subjects to programming problems for practice,
    from basic to premium courses, from technologies to entrance examinations,
    we have been building ample content with superior quality. In a short span,
    we have built a community of 1 Million+ Geeks around the world, 20,000+
    Contributors and 500+ Campus Ambassadors in various colleges across the nation.
    Our success stories include a lot of students who benefitted in their placements
    and landed jobs at tech giants. Our vision is to build a gigantic network of
        geeks and we are only a fraction of it yet.</string>
