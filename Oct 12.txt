Today we learnt about Apache Kafka in Big Data.
It is an open source of Linkedin written in Java and Scala.It is used for real time streams of data, to collect big data, or to do real time analysis.
It has 2 systems :
1.Point to point message system
2.Pubsub message system :Topicwise data is stored.
the main components of this system are:
1.Producer
2.Broker
3.Reciever.




We were taught about DSA topics- STL(Sets ,Multisets) and Binary Search
1.SETS:  set<int>s;
  Sets are a Type of container which store values with following properties:
  i.unique
  ii.sorted
  iii.Insertion : O(log n):s.insert(x);
  iv.erase:O(logN): s,erase(x);

2.MULTISETS: multiset<int>a;
  Multisets are similar to sets with exception that they can have duplicate values
  i.can have same values
  ii.sorted
  iii.m.erase(x);   erase all values equal to x
  iv.m.erase(m.find(x));  erase the value at location of x;




Binary Search 
it is implemented on Monotonous function 
and Predicate function is checked which returns boolean value.
