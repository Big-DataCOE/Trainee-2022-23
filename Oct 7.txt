Today we learnt about app development.
App development is a professional domain in which softwares are created which run on some specific devices and platforms.
It has two categories:
1.Native:-in this type app is build to be executed only on one specific platform e.g. ios or android.
          Android:-java,kotlin
          IOS:- swift
2.Hybrid:-this involves development of apps which can be executed on multiple platforms i.e. both on android and ios.
          flutter is used for hybrid app development.
An android project has following components in flutter:
1.Android & Ios folders: used for running the app in different platforms.
2.Lib file: this is the main folder where everything related to designing and working of app is stored by programming.
            It contains all the dart files with initial file automically formed as Main.dart.
3.Assets:this folder contains all the resources items including images fonts and others elements we use in our app.


In flutter smallest element is a widget. Each and every element in flutter is a widget including buttons, textfields, textviews, etc.
