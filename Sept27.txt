BIG DATA CENTRE OF EXCELLENCE PROBATION PERIOD.

Today we were taught about the Git and Github by our 3rd Year senior mentors.

"GIT" in simple terms is a version control system that is used such that multiple people can collaborate on a single codebase , and if some new update rollout causes the project to get bugs then it can be used to revert back to the time where the project was working seamlessly.

"GITHUB" is the repository hosting platform where in this history is exactly stored.

We were taught about the basic Terminal commands such as "cd","mkdir","ls","touch",etc.
Also various Git commands were taught :
1. git config --global user.name/user.email: to be associated with the global user connected to GitHub.
2. git init: to initialise the GitHub repository i.e. to call all the git commands in to this directory.
3. git status : to look at the unstaged files.
4. git add: to add the files into the staging area.
5. git commit -m "//message" : to commit the changes made.
6. git log: to show all the commits in the branch's history.
7. git branch : to create new branch as it is advised to create a new branch every time you do a pull request.
8.git checkout: to move the header to the new branch.
9.git push origin main: to push all the commits to the GitHub repo in the main branch(main can be replaced by any other branch name).
10. git merge: to merge the specified branch into the original main branch.

Also concepts of Forking branching pushing squashing commits was taught.

ALSO A DETAILED CHEATSHEET FOR GITHUB WAS PROVIDED TO ALWAYS
REFER.
