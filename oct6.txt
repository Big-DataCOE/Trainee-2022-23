Today we were taught about tools and features of Big Data.
We learnt about HDFS which stands for Hadoop Distributed File System. It is the primary data storage system used by Hadoop applications.
It is an open source distributed processing framework that manages data processing and storage for big data applications.
Secondly we were told about Map Reduce which  is a programming model for writing applications that can process Big Data 
in parallel on multiple nodes.It provies fast processing, efficient computing and safety to the collected data.
We also came to know about YARN i.e, Yet Another Resource Negotiator.It is the second generation of hadoop.
It  is designed for cluster management and is one of the key features in the second generation of Hadoop.
Thank you
