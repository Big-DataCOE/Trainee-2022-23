Today we were taught about Big Data and its tools.
Big Data have 5 Vs feature: Volume, vareity, velocity, value, veracity.
Volume: a very large amount of data is collected from real world and various other sources.
Vareity: collected data is of a number of vareities like images, text,audios,etc.
Velocity:It refers to the speed at which server gets data .Processing on data is made very fast using approaches like HDFS, map reduction etc.
value:data is analysed based on its value or importance to the user or analysist.
veracity: the accuracy of the data or information.

We came to know about HDFS i.e. Hadoop Distributed File System in file data is processed by dividing it into different nodes and 
with parallel processing which increases speed of processing, reduces load and provide safety to data by replicating it, this is based on 
Map Reduction.
